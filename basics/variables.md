 In programming (javascript), variables are containers for values that change. Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it. Variables are declared with the **var** keyword as follows.
 
 <pre>
 var x = 5;
 var y = 6;
 var z = x+y;
 </pre>
 
 >In this example:
 <pre>
 x stores the value 5
 y stores the value 6
 z stores the value 11
 </pre>

 #### JavaScript Variable Scope
 The scope is the region in which the variable is defined. JavaScript variables have only two scopes.

 **Global Variables** − A global variable has global scope which means it can be defined anywhere in your JavaScript code.

 **Local Variables** − A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined. Function parameters are always local to that function.
