/*
SUMMARY:

Generators are created by the generator function function* f(){}.

Generators do not execute its body immediately when they are invoked.

Generators can pause midway and resumes their executions where they were paused. The yield statement pauses the execution of a generator and returns a value.

Generators are iterable so you can use them with the for...of loop.
